Various theoretical approaches will be applied to specific historical developments in U.S. racialized structures as they pertain to African Americans. We will begin by challenging and historicizing the concept of "race."  Our attention will then turn to various empirical studies on the position of African Americans within various institutions including, but not limited to labor market, wealth, legal system, education, housing, healthcare, politics, etc.  Then we will examine the various strands of racial ideology that have arisen to legitimate and perpetuate racialized structural inequality.

Do some objects contaminate those with whom they come into contact, while others have medicinal powers or bestow good fortune? In what circumstances are objects and owners" inseparable? This course examines material culture, or things, from two related perspectives: the object and its owner. As Appadurai observes, "objects have social lives" that are sometimes independent from their owners. Objects such as kula shells are treasured by their temporary owners and desired by others because they have a lengthy and renowned history of circulation between the Pacific"s Trobriand Islands, whereas some Pacific Northwest Indians amass objects only to give them away in a ritualized ceremony--a Potlach--in order to become "big men." In certain societies the presence of key resources, such as designer clothing or cooking implements, permits their possessors to have social lives that lead to the expansion of social networks and community building or political advancement. In this course, we will examine a range of theories that correspond to these related approaches to material culture. From classic texts on circulation and exchange to theories on materiality, consumption and object fetishism, our investigation of objects and owners looks at an array of case studies from across the globe to better understand the life of objects and the lives objects engendered in order to illuminate connections between people and possessions.
